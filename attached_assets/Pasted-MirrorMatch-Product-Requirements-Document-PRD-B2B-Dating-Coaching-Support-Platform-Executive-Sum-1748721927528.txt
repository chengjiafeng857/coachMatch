MirrorMatch Product Requirements Document (PRD)
B2B Dating Coaching Support Platform
Executive Summary
MirrorMatch is a specialized B2B platform designed exclusively for dating and relationship coaches to enhance their client support capabilities. Unlike generic coaching platforms, MirrorMatch addresses the unique challenges dating coaches face: lack of client engagement between sessions, absence of dating-specific practice tools, and limited feedback collection systems for dating interactions.
 
Market Problem & Opportunity
Current Market Gaps
Research shows that dating coaches face significant challenges that current technology doesn't address:
1.	Client Engagement Crisis: 78% of clients struggle to maintain momentum between coaching sessions, leading to slower progress and higher dropout rates
2.	Generic Tools: Existing coaching platforms (Paperbell, CoachVantage, UpCoach) focus on business management but lack dating-specific skill development features
3.	Feedback Collection Gap: No systematic way for coaches to collect anonymous feedback from clients' real dating experiences
4.	Practice Tool Shortage: Limited options for clients to practice dating skills in a safe, structured environment
5.	Between-Session Support: Current platforms provide minimal support for maintaining client progress between sessions
Target Market Size
•	Dating Coaching Industry: $145,000 average annual revenue per coach, with 17% annual growth
•	Coaching Technology Market: $7.31 billion by 2025, growing at 17% CAGR
•	Primary Target: 10,000+ active dating coaches globally seeking specialized client support tools
